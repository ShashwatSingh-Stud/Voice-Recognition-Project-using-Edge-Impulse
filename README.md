# Voice-Recognition-Project-using-Edge-Impulse
This repository documents a voice recognition project that leverages the Edge Impulse platform to create a machine learning model for recognizing specific voice commands. This project demonstrates how to capture audio, train a model, and deploy it to a low-power edge device for real-time applications.
